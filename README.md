# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from _The Odin Project_ curriculum.
It is a simple website that contains a main index page and links to a few recipes.

**Project goals and demonstrated skills:**

- Creating the basic structure of an HTML file.
- Working with essential elements: Images, Links, Ordered and Unordered Lists.
- Practicing the Git workflow: creating repositories, committing changes and pushing code to GitHub.
